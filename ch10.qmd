# Features

The following list of features is a suggestion which may be expanded upon or overridden in an OpenD10 implementation. 

```{python}
# Create Features Table
#| label: tbl-features
#| tbl-cap: Features
#| echo: false

    **Design Note**: Because credits are a form of experience points in OpenD10, the Invested feature allows for characters to essentially gain experience points over time without actively adventuring. This feature should be limited to situations where an implementation's game balance takes this feature into account. 

## Codes of Honor

Values are assigned on a scale of 1-5 where:

* One (1) rarely limits the character's ability to behave however they want, and 
* Five (5) makes them incapable of doing anything other living in a controlled environment and assiduously adhering to their code.

Examples: 

* Pirate's Code (Value 1)
* Assassin's Code (Value 2)
* Chivalry (Value 3)
* Bushido (Value 3)
* Ascetic's Code (Value 4)
* Isolationism (Value 5)
