## Melee Weapons
A character using a melee weapon adds 1/5 of their Strength to damage rolls. Some weapons may allow a player to add 1/5 of their Agility instead.

```{python}
# Build melee weapons table
#| label: tbl-melee
#| tbl-cap: Melee Weapons
#| echo: false

from sysdef import *

melee_data = pd.read_json('melee_weapons.json')

melee_table = melee_data.T
melee_table["Credit Cost"] = round(melee_pricer(melee_table["dice"],melee_table["pips"]) * (1 - gear_discount) * credits_per_xp)

display(md(tabulate(melee_table,
           headers=["Name","Dice Damage", "Pips Damage", "Credits Cost"])))
```

## Ranged Weapons
Ranged weapons have difficulties associated with the ranges at which they can be used. In the following table:

* 'PB' = Point Blank Range,
* 'S' = Short Range,
* 'M' = Moderate Range, and
* 'L' = Long Range.

More information on range is presented in the Combat section.

```{python}
# Build ranged weapons table
#| label: tbl-ranged
#| tbl-cap: Ranged Weapons
#| echo: false

# Design Note: Ranged weapons are more difficult to use than melee ones. Targets
# are farther: harder to see, small movements of the barrel mean missing by
# meters, etc. From a game balance perspective PCs at range have the advantage
# against enemies that can only use melee abilities. This is balanced in two
# places. When items are defined, the ability to use them at range is balanced
# at each range segment. Some weapons are easier to use up close (75 or 100),
# others almost impossible (a 300). In the combat balance section we'll address
# the XP cost of ranged abilities - this will cover the cinematic balance.

ranged_data = pd.read_json('ranged_weapons.json')

ranged_table = ranged_data.T

ranged_table["Credit Cost"] = round(ranged_pricer(ranged_table["dice"],
                                                  ranged_table["pips"],
                                                  ranged_table["PB"],
                                                  ranged_table["S"],
                                                  ranged_table["M"],
                                                  ranged_table["L"])* credits_per_xp * 
                                                  (1 - gear_discount))

display(md(tabulate(ranged_table,
           headers=["Name","Dice Damage", "Pips Damage",
                    "PB", "S", "M", "L", "Credits Cost"])))
```

## Armor

```{python}
# Build armor table
#| label: tbl-armor
#| tbl-cap: Armor
#| echo: false

armor_data = pd.read_json('armor.json')

armor_table = armor_data.T

armor_table["Credit Cost"] = round(melee_pricer(0, armor_table["pips"]) * 
    (1 - gear_discount) * credits_per_xp)

display(md(tabulate(armor_table,
           headers=["Name", "Armor Value", "Credits Cost"])))
```

## Other Gear

```{python}
display(md(f"For items that replicate a feature or ability, multiply the XP cost by {credits_per_xp * (1 - gear_discount)}."))
```

```{python}
display(md(f"For all other gear multiply the real world cost in US Dollars by {credits_per_xp / 10}."))
```
