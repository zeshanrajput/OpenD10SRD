Costs 1 per 1000 credits.\n:::\n:::\n\n\n    **Design Note**: Because credits are a form of experience points in OpenD10, the Invested feature allows for characters to essentially gain experience points over time without actively adventuring. This feature should be limited to situations where an implementation's game balance takes this feature into account. \n\n## Codes of Honor\n\nValues are assigned on a scale of 1-5 where:\n\n* One (1) rarely limits the character's ability to behave however they want, and \n* Five (5) makes them incapable of doing anything other living in a controlled environment and assiduously adhering to their code.\n\nExamples: \n\n* Pirate's Code (Value 1)\n* Assassin's Code (Value 2)\n* Chivalry (Value 3)\n* Bushido (Value 3)\n* Ascetic's Code (Value 4)\n* Isolationism (Value 5)\n\n",
