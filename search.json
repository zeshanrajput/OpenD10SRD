    "section": "3.1 Checks",
    "text": "3.1 Checks\nTo determine if a character is successful at a task, Game Masters (GMs) assign a difficulty rating from 1 to 300, where 1 is impossible to fail and 300 is impossible for an individual to succeed. When assigning a difficulty rating, the GM considers factors such as the difficulty of the task, the environment, and the circumstances.\nHere are some examples of difficulty ratings:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifficulty Level\nDescription\nMore Detail\n\n\n\n\n50\nVery Easy\nUntrained people will succeed most of the time. No checks below this.\n\n\n75\nEasy\naverage untrained person can do this half of the time\n\n\n100\nModerate\naverage professional can do this half of the time\n\n\n125\nDifficult\nthe best an untrained person can do without help\n\n\n150\nVery Difficult\nthe best a professional can do without help\n\n\n300\nHeroic\nthe best anyone can possibly do without help\n\n\n\nThe character’s relevant attribute and skill ratings are subtracted from the difficulty rating to yield the target number. The player then rolls a d100. If the result is equal to or above the target number, the character succeeds. Otherwise the character fails at that task. The target number represents the minimum number that the player must roll on the d100 in order to succeed at the task.\nIf a player rolls a number that is 25 or more points above the difficulty number, they may achieve exceptional success. This means that they succeed at the task with ease, and they may also have some additional benefits, such as finding a hidden compartment or gaining a magical blessing. If a player rolls a number that is 25 or more points below the difficulty number, they may suffer an exceptional failure. This means that they fail at the task spectacularly, and they may also have some negative consequences, such as being injured or cursed.\nFinally, if a player rolls two zeros on the d100, this may be considered an automatic success, divine intervention, or anything else that the GM arbitrates. If a player rolls a 01 on the d100, this may be considered an automatic failure, the hand of fate, the Devil’s curse, or anything else that the GM deems necessary.\nThe GM has a lot of flexibility when it comes to arbitrating exceptional successes, failures, and divine intervention. They can decide how much of an impact these events have on the game, and they can also add some flavor to the events to make them more memorable.\nOpenD10 is a simple and easy-to-learn TTRPG that is perfect for players of all experience levels. It is also a versatile system that can be used to create a wide variety of fantasy and science fiction worlds."

    "text": "4.3 Classes, Races, and Backgrounds\nMost implementations of OpenD10 will have a set of classes that fit the theme of that implementation. These may be mages and knights in a fantasy setting, spies and soldiers in contemporary settings, spaceship captains and temporal engineers in science-fiction settings, and so on. Classes should convey a sense of that character’s role on the team and be complementary with other classes to complete a wide variety of challenges.\nClasses are implemented as packages of skills and features. For example, a mage might have bonuses to magic skills and features that allow them access to supernatural (i.e. magical) abilities. Classes should be balanced against each other, so that no one class is significantly stronger or weaker than the others. To balance classes, ensure that the point values for the attributes, skills, and features they grant are equal.\nRaces are optional additional packages describing a character’s heritage that may be offered as part of an implementation. A fantasy or space opera setting may have many races, while a contemporary setting would only have one or a very few. Races should be used to convey natural talents (such as darkvision or sensitivity to gravity) but not stereotypes (such as ‘Dwarves usually don’t do magic’).\nBackgrounds are another type of package that may allow a player to select from thematically appropriate origins for their character. Both races and backgrounds are implemented as packages of skills and features. These need not necessarily be balanced - instead deduct a number of points from their character creation pool equal to the cost of the race or background."

An example of a piece of gear could be a laser gun.\nAn ability is an inherent piece of ‘gear’ - some way that a character has to solve certain problems more easily (or at all). A character that could fire a laser beam from their eyes has an ability to do so. Abilities are purchased using experience points.\nThe cost of a piece of gear is normally derived from factors such as:\n\nThe bonus it confers to a check (the ‘quality’ of the gear),\nHow often that check will occur,\nWhether the gear is consumed when used,\nHow available the gear or its constituent parts are, and so on.\n\nThe cost of a piece of gear is derived the same way as the cost for an ability, except that gear is discounted for the ability to be stolen, broken, etc. In OpenD10 GMs must be cautious about the amount of loot players obtain, as this can equate to unexpected experience point gain and impact game balance."

    "text": "16.2 Abilities\nAbilities are supernatural manifestations fueled by energy from one axis. An AI draws from the technology realm when they scry, while an angel draws from the spiritual realms when they smite their foes. Similarly material beings with supernatural abilities draw strength from one axis. When the ‘Supernatural’ feature is selected, the player must identify which axis their character draws strength from. When the character learns the ‘Supernatural’ skill, they must also immediately specialize in their axis.\n\n16.2.1 Impact of a character’s Supernatural Axis\nEach possible supernatural axis has some strengths and weaknesses.\n\nMental: Psychic abilities have no somatic, verbal, or material requirements. They are the most costly to learn but are difficult to interrupt. Mental abilities do not diminish in the planes of other axes. Core Attribute: Manipulation.\nTechnological: Technological abilities may be paid for with credits instead of experience points. When chosen, the player may choose wetware or hardware. Hardware abilities, such as those from cybernetic implants, are discounted but cause a permanent reduction in mana pool. Wetware does not cause a reduction in mana pool but are more expensive. Core Attribute: Wisdom.\nMagical: Magical abilities require at least one somatic, verbal, and/or material component. As such, they are the easiest to interrupt or counter but are the most accessible supernatural axis. Core Attribute: Intelligence.\nSpiritual: Spiritual abilities derive from a patron deity or faction from the spiritual realms. Those patron deities may limit access to abilities, classes, or revoke abilities for behavior inconsistent with their goals. Core Attribute: Charisma.\nMaterial: Abilities powered by the material realm draw from the energy of the cosmos. Fusion reactors, chemical batteries, and gravity fall into this category. These abilities are accessed by purchasing gear which can be lost, stolen, or broken. The rules for purchasing gear are covered in Character Creation.\n\n\n\n16.2.2 Optional Rule: Single Class / Limited Classes\nA character may only have access to a few types of abilities from their axis, perhaps even as few as one. The ‘Supernatural’ feat is discounted by the ratio of selected classes over available classes. Optionally, certain supernatural axes may only have access to a subset of classes.\n\n\n16.2.3 Optional Rule: Technowizardry\nThe technology to artificially imbue a person with supernatural ability exists under this optional rule. For example, a character may be able to access the Net by implanting a neural interface and connecting to a computer. The Supernatural feat is discounted and part of it may be paid for with credits as per the Technological Axis section.\n\n\n16.2.4 Optional Rule: Restoring Humanity\nNormally mana pool reductions caused by purchasing hardware abilities can never be restored. Furthermore once a character’s mana pool is reduced it can never be increased again, even if a character’s Willpower is increased. Under this optional rule, a character’s mana pool increases normally when their Willpower is increased even after purchasing hardware abilities. Optionally, a character can buy additional mana points at the same cost as the ‘Resilient’ feature.\n\n\n16.2.5 Focus\nSome abilities can be sustained for a duration, others indefinitely. Abilities may require Focus to sustain. A character can only focus on one ability at a time. While holding focus on an ability, characters may use other abilities or take actions that do not require focus. A character may drop focus at any time, at which point the ability immediately ends.\n\n\n16.2.6 Opposing Abilities and Defenses\nSome abilities can be resisted. Defense ratings are calculated during the ‘Completing the Character Form’ section of Character Creation. The user of the ability rolls a d100 check adding their axis’ Core Attribute + Supernatural (axis) skill. If the roll exceeds the target’s defense rating, the ability is successful.\n\n\n16.2.7 Creating Abilities\nAbilities can have one of four effects on the game universe:\n\nThey can convert energy from one form to another (mana points),\nThey can do work (such as moving an object from one place to another),\nThey can restore or deplete integrity (hit points), and\nThey can confer bonuses or penalties to skill checks.\n\nSome abilities may have multiple simultaneous effects. Other abilities may be better modeled by a series of effects.\nAbilities have two costs: an initial cost to acquire the ability and a recurring cost to use the ability. The initial cost is usually paid in experience points as the character learns the ability. Purchasing gear and gaining technology abilities may be paid for partially or wholly in credits. The recurring cost is paid using mana points. Some gear may require credits as the recurring cost, such as when buying ammunition or energy cells.\n\n\n16.2.8 Improving Abilities\nAbilities can be learned multiple times, and each copy of an ability can be modified per the ‘Creating and Repairing Items’ section. The ‘Supernatural’ skill is used to modify or repair supernatural abilities. Abilities are always considered ‘Network enabled/Enchanted/Spiritual’ to the axis they draw power from."
